# Data Boot Camp Project 1

<!-- Project Title -->
# Crime and Income in Nash Vegas

<!-- Team Members -->
# Hayden Bass, Matthew Skinner, Andrew McKinney, Joe Hnat

<!-- Project Description/Outline -->
# We are wanting to see how high income ranges in areas, high income areas, 
# low income areas compare when it comes to crime rates and types in Nashville.

<!-- Research Questions to Answer -->
# 1. Are crime rates more closely related to income disparity (high standard 
# deviation) or overall average income of the area (low standard deviation)?

# 2. How are the types of crimes in those two demographics different?

<!-- Datasets to Be Used -->
# Census for Income
# Will Need a Source for Crime Data

<!-- Rough Breakdown of Tasks -->
# Matt to scrap in Census Data
# Hayden to find source for Crime data based on feedback
# Secondary idea - Using weather and traffic/accident data to see how weather conditions affect crashes and traffic.
